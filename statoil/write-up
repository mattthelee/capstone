initial cnn tests with just one bacnd gave poor results. 0.5305, which is as good as guessing. 

Next step is to combine the two bands and make each one a channel in an image
This still resulted in poor results of 0.5305 accuracy. I can try adding the incidence angle in but at the moment the model is'nt performing well enough. 

Next step is to setup some kind of gridsearch to try changing all the parameters. 



If i need to do more then i need to try injecting the incidence angle into the fully connected layer.
